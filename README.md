# FUTURE_FS01_Task1 - Personal Portfolio (React + Vite)
Task 1 of Full Stack Web Development Internship with FutureInterns

This project was built using the following core technologies:
- React
- Vite (as the build tool)

## Local Setup and Development

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

### Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
